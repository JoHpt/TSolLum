Introduction
____________
This spectra analysis program is designed to analyze simulated transmission spectra and saves
the results in form of optical parameters like Tlum(Me), Tlum(Sc), Tsol(Me), Tsol(Sc), ΔTlum,
ΔTsol and ΔT@2500nm. It also plots those optical parameters in respect to the given layer thicknesses.

Mathematical Formlua
___________________
$T_{lum} = \frac{\int_{380\,nm}^{780\,nm}{T(\lambda)L(\lambda)g(\lambda)} d\lambda}{\int_{380\,nm}^{780\,nm}{L(\lambda)g(\lambda)} d\lambda}

$T_{sol} = \frac{\int_{200\,nm}^{3000\,nm}{T(\lambda)G(\lambda)} d\lambda}{\int_{200\,nm}^{3000\,nm}{G(\lambda)} d\lambda}

$\Delta T_{lum, sol} = T_{lum, sol}(semiconductive) - T_{lum, sol} (metallic)\\

$\Delta T_{@2500\,nm} = T_{@2500\,nm}(semiconductive) - T_{@2500\,nm}(metallic)\\

Requirements
____________
•	pandas
•	numpy
•	scipy
•	matplotlib

Installation
____________
1.	Ensure that Python is installed on your system by running python -V in the command line.
2.	Install the required packages by running the following statements in the command line:
	pip install pandas
	pip install numpy
	pip install scipy
	pip install matplotlib

Usage
_____
1.	Choose the appropriate folder. "mapping" is for the analysis of layer systems where two layer thicknesses have been varied (e.g. buffer and anti-reflective layer). "single spectrum" is for the calculation of one layer system.
2.	Put your simulated spectra into the " input_spectra" folder. The spectra must have the following structure:
a.	The .txt file name must contain the state of the VO2 (“_me_“ or “_sc_“ for metallic or semiconductive).
b.	The first column must represent the wavelength.
c.	The decimal values are marked with comma.
d.	For mapping:
i.	The .txt file name must contain the first/second thickness that was varied just for mapping.
ii.	The first row of the table must contain the first/second thickness that was varied.
3.	Run the program.
4.	The calculated results will be saved in the "output" folder.
5.	The plots generated by the program will be saved in the " output " folder. The plots are generated automatically

Note
____
For more information, such as naming the input spectra or structure of the mapping spectra, see docstrings of the main.py files.
